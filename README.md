# KNA LocalDB
KNA LocalDB is a database to store data on the users computer locally in one place (for .NET). 

We have our main KNA LocalDB (LDB) for building apps, and MyKNA to edit existing values outside the app (creating new local DBs using MyKNA will be added in the future).

KNA Documentation (basic usage for all apps):

(1.0)

This is slightly complicated as MyKNA is only meant to be edited within the code of a project.
